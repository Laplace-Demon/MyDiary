Today is Saint-Valentin, but it's also one special day at China:

the day of welcoming the god of MONEY

that's funny isn't it?



I've also realized that I should spend more time decorating my GitHub. Today, I saw the GitHub of one of my schoolmates, it's like all green, but he just put all the course projects or even math homeworks on it. I think a better GitHub would be of help to demonstrate myself better. So let me just start puting all the codes here.



I'm tired these days, but I think i'm on the correct path and all will get better

still waiting for interview results, longing to work in OCaml
