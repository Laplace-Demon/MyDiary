My diary

Hey, all the things here are about me. I think it would be good to note down random words flowing out of my mind, just like storing the eletricity power in battery. Typically, when I'm obliged to formulate structured texts, I'll keep ameliorating it by elaboraing on even the slightest word. But this is not the case here. I just make sure no grammar mistakes will appear and never go back.

I have two operating systems installed in my personal computer, and synchronising between them would be a torture. So I just make use of the graphic interface of Github, despite all the other functionalities it offers.
