I'm so tired, today is the journ√©e d'entreprise, and i'm just frustrated.

I can't find an internship, no company wants me. Maybe I'm not qualified enough, maybe I should stop reflecting on myself, but anyway, I feel physically and emotionally drained, I feel inferior, I feel disappointed.

I've been always longing to become a strong guy, like the genius excel at all cs-related stuff, and I regret to find that's not the case. I don't want to blame speit, i don't want to blame France

I think it's just me who has built the Rome. Truly, I will always be let slightly down when I find extra efforts have to be paid each time when I was trying to follow cs course, or just to read a cs book, those constant resentment have made much less motivated than before, and I do NOT blame past myself on that. I thought I've done a great job, and I do NOT take that back.

it's such a pity to see I've never become a computer genious, it really hurts. i can gather the power to try harder
