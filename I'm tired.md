I'm so tired, today is the journ√©e d'entreprise, and i'm just frustrated.

I can't find an internship, no company wants me. Maybe I'm not qualified enough, maybe I should stop reflecting on myself, but anyway, I feel physically and emotionally drained, I feel inferior, I feel disappointed.

I've been always longing to become a strong guy, like the genius excel at all cs-related stuff, and I regret to find that's not the case. I don't want to blame speit, i don't want to blame France

I think it's just me who has built the current scene. Truly, I've been always slightly down when I find extra efforts have to be paid to pursue a cs track, those constant resentment have made much less motivated than before, and motivation is what I need
